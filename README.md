# MaxentModelEvaluations
Easy to run scripts for evaluating many combinations of maxent parameters, as well as calculating ecological niche overlap subsample statistics.

Add species occurence points to the 'occurences' folder and add predictive layers to the 'layers' folder. Results will be placed into a 'models' folder with sub-folders for each species occurence point file.

Maxent model evaluations makes use of a forked version of the ENMeval package, found on my GitHub, which adds MaxKappa as an evaluation metric.
